## Teaching experience

  * **2017** Teaching Assistant for _Reliability Methods in Structural Engineering_ (8 students)
  * **2015** Teaching Assistant for _Pre-stressed Concrete_ (~ 30 students)
  * **2014** Teaching Assistant for _Structural Dynamics_ (~ 30 students)
  * **2014** Instructor in the _Estimation and Materials Testing_ lab (>100 students)
  * **2013** Instructor in the _Solid Mechanics_ lab (>100 students) 

## Mentoring experience

**2017** Mr. Dante Coronado and Mr. Aimane Najmeddine (Resilient and Sustainable Buildings project)

  * Tutored nonlinear dynamic analysis of buildings using OpenSees
  * Mentees designed workflows for node and element numbering, loads specification, material assignment, and analysis initiation
  * Mentees were able to perform seismic fragility analysis of a two-bay, two-story steel moment frame with concentrated plasticity non-linearity

## Teaching interests

Based on past experience, I find all aspects of teaching to be stimulating and rewarding: lecturing, interacting with the students, formulating problem sets, and lab experiments. I look forward to teaching analysis type courses such as Mechanics of Materials, Structural Analysis, and Statistics for Civil Engineers at the undergraduate level. At the graduate level, I am enthused to teach Advanced Structural Analysis, Finite Element Methods, and Dynamics of Structures, in addition to developing Reliability Analysis of Structures and Multihazard Engineering Analysis courses.
