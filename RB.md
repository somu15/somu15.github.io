Journal articles are complex to understand without spending sufficient time reading them. The aim of these research blogs is to discuss my research in a casual manner so as to aid in its easier comprehension. Following are the links to the discussion topics grouped under four research themes.

### 1. Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering

**Accelerogram amplitude scaling**

  * [Why understanding the seismology of scaled accelerograms is important for Earthquake Engineering?](Blogs/PBEE/Acc_Sca_1.md)
  

### 2. Data Analysis and Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification in Structural Engineering


* [Bayes rule and Markov Chain Monte Carlo](Blogs/BUQ/MCMC.md)


### 3. All Hazards Resilient and Sustainable Communities


* [Understanding the Markov hierarchy for infrastructure resilience assessment](Blogs/AHRSC/Markov.md)


### 4. Traditional and * Finite Element Methods
