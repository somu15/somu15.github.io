Journal articles are complex to understand without spending sufficient time reading them. The aim of these research blogs is to discuss my research in a casual manner so as to aid in its easier comprehension. Following are the links to the discussion topics grouped under the four research themes.

### 1. Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering

* **Accelerogram amplitude scaling**

  * [Why understanding the seismology of scaled accelerograms is important for Earthquake Engineering?](Blogs/PBEE/Acc_Sca_1.md)
  

### 2. Data Analysis and Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification

### 3. All Hazards Resilient and Sustainable Communities

### 4. Traditional and * Finite Element Methods
