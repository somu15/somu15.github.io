## Efficient small failure probability evalution using complex finite element models

<center><img style="float: center;" src="/img/Small_Pf.png" width="500"></center>

Developing two novel algorithms for an efficient assessment of small failure probabilities using computationally expensive finite element models: (1) A machine learning interface between high- and low-fidelity finite element models for variance reduction; and (2) Control variates subset simulation supported by machine learning. Case studies: (1) Reactor vessel embrittlement and cracking failure due to irradiation; (2) Thermal stress failure of a heat-pipe micro-reactor; and (3) Environmental hazard assessment of advanced nuclear fuels due to fission products release.

## Fluid-structure and soil-structure interaction analysis of advanced reactors

## Non-ergodic seismic hazard and risk evaluation

## Deep learning for complex systems recovery and resilience assessment under hazards

## Multihazard infrastructure resilience modeling

Proposed a stochastic model using Markov-type processes for recovery of systems subjected to multihazards. The model accounts for inter-event dependencies between multihazards during the system recovery. Also, proposed a resilience metric termed "Disfunctionality hazard" for supporting resilience-based decision making of systems subjected to multihazards. Disfunctionality hazard maps a system's functionality recovery curves to a risk space that is similar to the performance-based engineering framework.

Journal articles are complex to understand without spending sufficient time reading them. The aim of these research blogs is to discuss my research in a casual manner so as to aid in its easier comprehension. Following are the links to the discussion topics grouped under three research themes. Comments and suggestions for the improvement of my posts are welcome and can be directed to my Gmail: **somdhulipala9**.
