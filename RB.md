Journal articles are complex to understand without spending sufficient time reading them. The aim of these research blogs is to discuss my research in a casual manner so as to aid in its easier comprehension. Following are the links to the discussion topics grouped under four research themes.
<br/>

### 1. Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering
<br/>
