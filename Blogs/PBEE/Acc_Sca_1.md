title: Accelerogram Scaling
subtitle: Why understanding the seismology of scaled accelerograms is important for Earthquake Engineering?

**Earthquake Process** An earthquake is a complex process involving three main events: 1. rupture on the fault plane and generation of seismic waves (source); 2. seismic wave propagation (path); 3. ground motion on the surface (site). These three events associated with earthquakes are depcited in the figure below.

**Accelerograms and Scaling** Whenever an earthquake occurs, instruments called accelerometers spread across on the surface record the ground motion. This recorded motion is typically called an accelerogram since it is a plot of ground acceleration versus time. Accelerogram scaling, as it is practiced in Earthquake Engineering, involves scaling the amplitudes of a recorded accelerogram so as to intensify it. The below figure demonstrates this scaling procedure, wherein one of the 1994 Northridge accelerograms is scaled up five times. The scaled accelerogram is noted to have increased amplitudes than the unscaled one; however, the time variation of both these accelerograms is exactly the same.

**Why Scale Accelerograms?** Earthquake engineers have to assess the safety and reliability of building, bridges, and other infrastructure during strong earthquakes. Earthquakes which have large magnitudes and which happen at small distances from infrastructure can be characterized as being strong. [Accelerogram recordings from such strong earthquakes are scarce](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eqe.695). For example, the fraction of magnitude greater than 6.5 and distance less than 20Km accelerograms in the [NGA-West2 ground motion database](https://ngawest2.berkeley.edu/) is less than ten percent. Owing to this scarcity of strong recorded accelerograms and the necessity of engineers to assess infrastructure earthquake performance, accelerograms are scaled.

**Use of Scaled Accelerograms** Scaled accelerograms are used for two main purposes: 1. ground motion selection; 2. structural response analysis. In ground motion selection, accelerograms are scaled so that they match a target response spectrum such the [ASCE 7-16 design spectrum](https://www.asce.org/asce-7/) or the [Conditional Mean Spectrum](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/full/10.1061/%28ASCE%29ST.1943-541X.0000215). The figure below towards the left presents a suite of scaled accelerograms in Orange matched to a target response spectrum in Blue. Once accelerograms are scaled and matched, they are then used to study the response of structural models. Accelerogram scaling is also used for structural damage and collapse analysis using procedures such as [Incremental Dynamic Analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eqe.141) and [Multiple Stripe Analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/eqe.876). In such analysis procedures, accelerograms are scaled such that their intensities at an oscillator period (typically the fundamental structural period) match a design intensity level obtained from [seismic hazard analysis](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/interactive/). These scaled accelerograms are then used for seismic response analysis to quantify the [probability of damage or collapse of structures given the intesity level](https://www.earthquakespectra.org/doi/full/10.1193/021113EQS025M). The figure below towards the right presents a collapse fragiltiy curve of a building obtained using Incremental Dynamic Analysis with earthquake intensity (in terms of spectral acceleration at the fundamental period) on the x-axis and the collapse probability on the y-axis.
