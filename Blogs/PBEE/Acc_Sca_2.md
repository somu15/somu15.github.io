**Beginning from First Principles.** Understanding the seismic characteristics of scaled accelerograms requires us to visit the mechanics of earthquake processes. By visiting the earthquake mechanics, per the author's opinion, we can gain insights into the physics of the scaling process. Such a comprehension of the physics will further enable us to inform, in a better way, about the safety of infrastructure under strong earthquakes by attributing some character to the scaling procedure. As discussed in the [Previous Post](https://somu15.github.io/Blogs/PBEE/Acc_Sca_1/), earthquake safety assessment of infrastructure may routinely rely on scaling accelerograms.

**Earthquake Mechanics.** The earthquake process and its effects, as summarized in the figure below, can be divided into three components: (1) rupture on the fault plane and generation of seismic waves; (2) propagation (which leads to dissipation and attenuation) of seismic waves through the medium surrounding the fault plane; (3) reception of the seismic waves at a recording station in the form of an accelerogram.

The ground motion at a site caused due to rupture on the fault plane is mathematically described by the [Representation Theorem in seismology](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~richards/Aki_Richards.html), which is derived from elastodynamical priciples (or the [dynamic equations of motion for a deformable body](https://books.google.com/books/about/Advanced_Mechanics_Of_Solids.html?id=k1BNuAAACAAJ)). The Representation Theorem can be described as a cornerstone of seismology, providing theoretical as well as observational insights on earthquakes. The definition of [moment magnitude for an earthquake](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=VV0mV4lF0RUC&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=info:23gwx471TAQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=EpH0u8A5gg&sig=h4P3Hzkh7-fXiU-usi5uVRWIlbo#v=onepage&q&f=false) and the development of [hybrid ground motion simulation methods](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/bssa/article/100/5A/2095/325180/broadband-ground-motion-simulation-using-a-hybrid) find their roots in the Representation Theorem. Whenever an earthquake occurs, earthquake monitoring agencies may rely on the Representation theorem to infer the [slip distribution over the fault plane](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/bssa/article/92/4/1192/120765/source-description-of-the-1999-hector-mine) given the ground motion at a site. Owing to this key role the Representation theorem plays in seismology, it will be used as means to understand the seismic characteristics of scaled accelerograms.   

**(Informal) Representation Theorem.** Ground motion at a site on the earth's surface, using the Representation Theorem, can be expressed as a function of three components: (1) fault strength and geometry; (2) rupture amplitude over the fault; and (3) impulse response of the propagating medium. The figure below presents the Representation Theorem in an informal fashion. For the formal definition, refer to equation (2.41) in [Aki and Richards 2002](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~richards/Aki_Richards.html).
