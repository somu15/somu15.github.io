Proposed a stochastic model using Markov-type processes for recovery of systems subjected to multihazards. The model accounts for inter-event dependencies between multihazards during the system recovery, thereby, delaying system recovery after a new hazard event when the recovery from a previous event is not complete. Also proposed a resilience metric termed "Disfunctionality hazard" for supporting resilience-based decision making of systems subjected to multihazards. Disfunctionality hazard maps a system's functionality recovery curves to a risk space that is similar to the performance-based engineering framework.
